> Capturing to a PIL Image 

`安装PIL(python image library)  `
`http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm`

```bash
$ tar xvfz Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz
$ cd Imaging-1.1.7
$ python setup.py install
```


```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#在这安装PIL http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm
import io
import time
import picamera
from PIL import Image

# Create the in-memory stream
stream = io.BytesIO()
with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    time.sleep(2)
    camera.capture(stream, format='jpeg')
# "Rewind" the stream to the beginning so we can read its content
stream.seek(0)
image = Image.open(stream)
```

> Capturing to an OpenCV object

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#This is another variation on Capturing to a stream. First we’ll capture an image to a BytesIO stream (Python’s in-memory stream class), then convert the stream to a numpy array and read the array with OpenCV:

import io
import time
import picamera
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Create the in-memory stream
stream = io.BytesIO()
with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    time.sleep(2)
    camera.capture(stream, format='jpeg')
# Construct a numpy array from the stream
data = np.fromstring(stream.getvalue(), dtype=np.uint8)
# "Decode" the image from the array, preserving colour
image = cv2.imdecode(data, 1)
# OpenCV returns an array with data in BGR order. If you want RGB instead
# use the following...
image = image[:, :, ::-1]
```

>  Capturing resized images

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#修改照片尺寸
#Sometimes, particularly in scripts which will perform some sort of analysis or processing on images, you may wish to capture smaller images than the current resolution of the camera. Although such resizing can be performed using libraries like PIL or OpenCV, it is considerably more efficient to have the Pi’s GPU perform the resizing when capturing the image. This can be done with the resize parameter of the capture() methods:
#The resize parameter can also be specified when recording video with the start_recording() method.
import time
import picamera

with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.resolution = (1024, 768)
    camera.start_preview()
    # Camera warm-up time
    time.sleep(2)
    camera.capture('foo.jpg', resize=(320, 240))
```
