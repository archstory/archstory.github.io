> Capturing to a PIL Image 

`安装PIL(python image library)  `
`http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm`

```bash
$ tar xvfz Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz
$ cd Imaging-1.1.7
$ python setup.py install
```


```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#在这安装PIL http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm
import io
import time
import picamera
from PIL import Image

# Create the in-memory stream
stream = io.BytesIO()
with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    time.sleep(2)
    camera.capture(stream, format='jpeg')
# "Rewind" the stream to the beginning so we can read its content
stream.seek(0)
image = Image.open(stream)
```

> Capturing to an OpenCV object

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#This is another variation on Capturing to a stream. First we’ll capture an image to a BytesIO stream (Python’s in-memory stream class), then convert the stream to a numpy array and read the array with OpenCV:

import io
import time
import picamera
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Create the in-memory stream
stream = io.BytesIO()
with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    time.sleep(2)
    camera.capture(stream, format='jpeg')
# Construct a numpy array from the stream
data = np.fromstring(stream.getvalue(), dtype=np.uint8)
# "Decode" the image from the array, preserving colour
image = cv2.imdecode(data, 1)
# OpenCV returns an array with data in BGR order. If you want RGB instead
# use the following...
image = image[:, :, ::-1]
```
