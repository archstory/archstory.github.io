> Capturing to a PIL Image 

`安装PIL(python image library)  `

```bash
$ tar xvfz Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz
$ cd Imaging-1.1.7
$ python setup.py install
```


```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#在这安装PIL http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm
import io
import time
import picamera
from PIL import Image

# Create the in-memory stream
stream = io.BytesIO()
with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:
    camera.start_preview()
    time.sleep(2)
    camera.capture(stream, format='jpeg')
# "Rewind" the stream to the beginning so we can read its content
stream.seek(0)
image = Image.open(stream)
```
